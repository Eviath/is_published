# IsPublished

Simple RubyGem which adds scope .published to any rails model you want!

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'is_published'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it manually on local machine

    $ gem install is_published

## Model and migrations
##### Before all. Class you want to extend with this gem, needs to have column 'published' in the database.

###-- If you dont have created migrations and model

Gem comes with migrations and model generator, you can create one with this command:

```ruby
rails g is_published:install [MODEL NAME]
```

For example:

    rails g is_published:install Article  

which will create model and migrations with provided name.

Migration will look like this
```ruby
class CreateArticles < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :articles do |t|
      t.string :title
      t.string :body
      t.boolean :published, default: false
      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```
Model class comes with already extended gem scope, its going to look like this one

```ruby
class Article < ApplicationRecord
  extend IsPublished::Scopes
end
```

If needed, you can customize migrations before running them.

After running generator command, run migration.

    rails db:migrate
    
####And you are good to go! Proceed to gem usage information!



*** 
## -- If you have already model and migrations

If your model table already exists, you can create migration to add published column like this:

```ruby
rails g migration AddPublishedColumnToPosts published:boolean
```

Generated migration should now look like this:
```ruby
class AddPublishedColumnToPosts < ActiveRecord::Migration[6.0]
  def change
    add_column :posts, :published, :boolean, default: false
  end
end
```
Default value of 'published' should be 'false', rails generator doesnt allow that in generator command, you have to edit migration by yourself.

When database is ready, you can start with gem setup.
***

Add code below to any Ruby class to add scope .where(published: true) 

```ruby
class Post < ApplicationRecord
  # Here you extend your class with gem
  extend IsPublished::Scopes
end
```

Now you are done.

## Gem usage
After you are done with migrations and model setup, you can use published scope like this.
```ruby
Post.published 
#=>  => #<Post id: 1, title: "Published post", user_id: 1, published: true, created_at: "2019-06-07 14:42:22", updated_at: "2019-06-07 16:51:07">

Post.find(1).published?
#=> true
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
